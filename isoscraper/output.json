For Operational Control purposes, the\n\npoint of demarcation for the Interconnection is the point at which the New England – New Brunswick\n\nInterconnection crosses the USA-Canada boundary.\n\n**List of Interconnection(s)**\n\nThe New England-New Brunswick Interconnection is comprised of the following two (2) Interties (as\n\nordered from South to North:\n\n1. 390/3016 Intertie\n\nA 345 kV AC transmission circuit, designated the 390 Line/3016 Line, connecting the Orrington\n\ntransmission substation in the State of Maine, USA to the Point Lepreau transmission substation in the\n\nProvince of New Brunswick, Canada. The common meter point for this Intertie is located at the Point\n\nLepreau transmission substation.\n\n2. 3001 Intertie\n\nA 345 kV AC transmission circuit, designated the 3001 Line, connecting the Keene Road transmission\n\nsubstation in the State of Maine, USA to the Keswick transmission substation in the Province of New\n\nBrunswick, Canada. The common meter point for this Intertie is located at the Keswick transmission\n\nsubstation\n\n\n-----\n\n**SCHEDULE B:**\n\n**PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND**\n\n**AUTHORIZATION OF OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n**Overview**\n\nOperating Instructions (a) will be developed and recorded by the Coordination Committee in accordance\n\nwith this Schedule B, (b) will be contained in a document separate from this Agreement, and (c) may be\n\nmodified by the Coordination Committee without amending this Agreement.\n\nThe Coordination Committee shall jointly develop and approve Operating Instructions and review them at\n\nleast annually. The Coordination Committee shall submit draft material to one another for review and\n\ncomment. The Coordination Committee shall provide comment on the draft material promptly. The\n\nCoordination Committee shall promptly provide such information as may reasonably be required in\n\nconnection with establishing, or reviewing, the material. In the event that any conflicts arise or are made\n\napparent to a Party, they shall notify the other Party and engage the Coordination Committee if necessary\n\nto resolve such conflicts.\n\nThe Coordination Committee will periodically review applicable ISO-NE and NBSO individual\n\nprocedures and processes to determine any benefits of sharing these procedures and processes. These\n\nbenefits may be for the purpose of training or to satisfy Reliability Standards. The Coordination\n\nCommittee will determine how best to share these individual procedures and processes.\n\nA list of Operating Instructions and applicable ISO-NE and NBSO individual procedures will be\n\nmaintained by the Coordination Committee and posted on an appropriate location on the respective\n\nindividual websites of the Parties.\n\nOutlined below are the key principles and items of methodology to be observed while the Coordination\n\nCommittee is engaged in developing and approving Operating Instructions, and issuing them to their\n\nrespective operations staff.\n\n**Principles**\n\nGiven that the Parties’ respective operations staff benefit from following a single instruction for all\n\naspects of their execution of interconnected operations, it is an acceptable practice to combine this content\n\nto achieve the single Operating Instructions for use by a respective Party’s operations staff. The preferred\n\n\n-----\n\nmethodology when appropriate is to use the NPCC criteria, guides and procedures for the coordination\n\nand operation of the interconnected Transmission Systems. When the NPCC documentation is\n\ninsufficient to accomplish this task separate instructions will be developed in accordance with this\n\nschedule.\n\nEach Party shall coordinate the issuance internally of any Operating Instructions developed and agreed to\n\nby the Coordination Committee to ensure that their respective operations staff have these Operating\n\nInstructions. In addition annual review of the Operating Instructions and the Parties internal procedures\n\nassociated with the Operating Instructions shall be conducted by the Coordination Committee to ensure\n\nconsistency.\n\nOperating Instructions, when approved by the Coordination Committee, shall be binding on the Parties\n\ninsofar as they relate to the Interconnection Facilities until they expire, are changed, deleted, or\n\nsuperseded by authority of the Coordination Committee.\n\n**Items of Methodology**\n\nEach page of the approved Operating Instructions shall be identified in the header or footer as the NBSO\n\n– ISO-NE Coordination Committee’s with the Effective Date and any revision number.\n\nBy mutual agreement of the Coordination Committee, either the NBSO or ISO-NE shall control the\n\nrevision process from the initial drafting of material through to the conversion of the Operating\n\nInstruction into its final form.\n\n\n-----\n\n**SCHEDULE C:**\n\n**EMERGENCY AND SECURITY ENERGY TRANSACTIONS SCHEDULE**\n\nWHEREAS, ISO-NE, as the independent system operator of the Transmission System in New England\n\nand the administrator of the New England markets, arranges for the sale and purchase of Emergency\n\ncapacity and energy on behalf of Market Participants with neighboring Balancing Authority Areas, all in\n\naccordance with the ISO-NE Tariff, which includes the Open Access Transmission Tariff and Market\n\nRules;\n\nWHEREAS, ISO-NE is the administrator of the ISO-NE Tariff and is responsible for, among other\n\nmatters, procuring and acting as supplier of last resort of ancillary services (including arranging for the\n\nsale and purchase of Emergency capacity and energy with neighboring Balancing Authority Areas), in\n\naccordance with the ISO-NE Tariff;\n\nWHEREAS, either of the Parties may, from time to time, have insufficient Operating Reserve available\n\non the respective systems that they operate, or need to supplement available resources to cover sudden\n\nand unforeseen circumstances such as loss of equipment or forecast errors, and such conditions could\n\nresult in the need to arrange for the purchase of Emergency Energy for Reliability reasons;\n\nWHEREAS, from time to time, the total net interchange between the New England and New Brunswick\n\nBalancing Authority Areas of market-based real-time transactions in a given hour may be less than the\n\nminimum required flow from New Brunswick to New England on the New England to New Brunswick\n\nInterconnection, in accordance with the applicable Operating Instructions with respect to the\n\ndetermination of minimum transfer limits, and such conditions could result in the need to arrange for the\n\npurchase of Security Energy for Reliability reasons; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Parties wish to provide for the terms and conditions pursuant to which either Party may\n\narrange for the purchase of such Security Energy for its system from the other Party and specify the prices\n\nfor such purchases and sales.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants herein set forth, the\n\nParties mutually agree as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE 1.0:** **DELIVERY POINT**\n\n\n-----\n\n1.1 The Delivery Point for energy delivered pursuant to the terms of this Schedule shall be the\n\ninternational border between New England and New Brunswick. The Delivery Point is constituted of all\n\nof the points of direct Interconnection between the New England Balancing Authority Area and the\n\nNBSO Balancing Authority Area. Such Delivery Point shall include (1) the point on the 345 kV Keene\n\nRoad - Keswick transmission line (3001 Line) between the State of Maine, USA and the Province of New\n\nBrunswick, Canada at which the line crosses the international boundary, and (2) the point on the 345 kV\n\nOrrington - Point Lepreau transmission line (390/3016 Line) between the State of Maine, USA and the\n\nProvince of New Brunswick, Canada at which the line crosses the international boundary, and/or such\n\nother Delivery Point(s) as the Coordination Committee shall determine.\n\n1.2 Unless otherwise agreed by the Coordination Committee, the price for energy for an hour\n\ndelivered pursuant to this Schedule shall include all transmission costs of delivering such energy to the\n\nDelivery Point in that hour, and the Party taking delivery of such energy for the hour shall be responsible\n\nfor all transmission costs beyond the Delivery Point for that hour.\n\n**ARTICLE 2.0:** **CHARACTERISTICS OF EMERGENCY AND SECURITY ENERGY**\n\nAll Emergency Energy and Security Energy made available under this Schedule shall be three phase, 60\n\nHz alternating current at operating voltages established at the Delivery Point in accordance with system\n\nrequirements and appropriate to the Interconnection Facilities or other such characteristics as may be\n\nagreed upon by the Parties.\n\n**ARTICLE 3.0:** **NATURE OF SERVICE**\n\n3.1 ISO-NE and the NBSO shall, to the maximum extent each deems consistent with the safe and\n\nproper operation of its system, the furnishing of economical, dependable and satisfactory services by its\n\nparticipants, and the obligations of its participants to other parties, make available to the other Party when\n\na system Emergency exists on the other Party's system, Emergency Energy from its system's available\n\ngenerating capability in excess of the system’s load requirements (i.e., load requirements alone, not load\n\nplus reserve requirements) up to the transfer limits in use between the two Balancing Authority Areas.\n\nEmergency Energy is provided in cases of emergency outages of generating units, transmission lines or\n\nother equipment, or to meet other sudden and unforeseen circumstances such as forecast errors, or to\n\nprovide sufficient Operating Reserve. Normally, a Party requests Emergency Energy from the other Party\n\n\n-----\n\nas a last resort, when market-based real-time energy transactions are not available, or not available in a\n\ntimely fashion in order to maintain its ten-minute reserve requirement. At the time the Emergency\n\nEnergy sale is being initiated, the Party delivering such Emergency Energy shall describe the Emergency\n\nEnergy transaction as being one of the following: (1) “delivered out of ten-minute reserve”; (2) “delivered\n\nout of thirty-minute reserve” where such a delivery could reasonably be expected to be recalled if the\n\nParty delivering the Emergency Energy needed the generation for a reserve pick-up or other Emergency;\n\nor (3) “delivered above and beyond ten-minute and thirty-minute reserves” where the Party delivering\n\nsuch Emergency Energy is normally expected to be able to continue delivering the energy following a\n\nreserve pick-up.\n\n3.2 The Parties are participants in NPCC and are expected to comply with NPCC criteria, guides and\n\nprocedures. Such NPCC criteria include “Emergency Operation Criteria” (Document A-3), which\n\ndescribes the basic factors to be considered by a Balancing Authority Area in formulating plans and\n\nprocedures to be followed in an Emergency. A principle of operation in this NPCC criteria is that upon\n\nreceiving a request for assistance to mitigate an Emergency, a Balancing Authority Area would provide\n\n“maximum reasonable assistance” to a neighboring Balancing Authority Area. Such reasonable\n\nassistance would not normally require the shedding of firm load.\n\n3.3 Normally, the Party experiencing or anticipating an Emergency would request Emergency Energy\n\nfrom the other Party in accordance with this Schedule and applicable NPCC criteria, guides and\n\nprocedures after all market-based real-time transactions have been scheduled, unless there is an\n\nimmediate need for such Emergency Energy in order to maintain system Reliability.\n\n3.4 The Parties agree to arrange for the delivery of Security Energy, as needed, which shall be priced\n\nin accordance with Attachment B of this Schedule. Prior to the purchase of Security Energy in\n\naccordance with Attachment B of this Schedule, ISO-NE will take the following actions (unless exigent\n\ncircumstances dictate otherwise), as necessary and in the following order, in coordination with Market\n\nParticipants and the New Brunswick System Operator to avoid or correct the violation of the minimum\n\nflow requirement:\n\n1. Curtail exports from New England to New Brunswick.\n\n2. Request Security Energy Transactions (SETs)\n\n\n-----\n\na. ISO-NE will post a message, “Special Request for Security Energy Transactions,” to the\n\n“Special Notices” section of the ISO-NE external website. The special notice will request the\n\nsubmittal of SETs for specified hour(s) and amount(s).\n\nb. SETs may be submitted to ISO-NE via the external transaction scheduling software as\n\nimports with the designation, “Security Energy Transactions” and may be submitted as either\n\nSelf-Scheduled (“Real-Time without Price”) or Dispatchable (“Real-Time with Price”). SETs\n\nmay be submitted up to sixty minutes prior to the top of the hour in which the transaction is\n\nrequested to begin.\n\n3. Energy (including Security Energy Transactions) is scheduled for the next hour to the required MW\n\nlevel, based on economics, from all available offers in sufficient quantity to correct the potential or actual\n\nviolation.\n\n4. If steps 1 through 3 above do not fully correct the potential or actual violation, then Control-Area-to\nControl-Area Security Energy will be scheduled in accordance with the provisions of Attachment B to\n\nsatisfy the minimum flow requirement.\n\n3.5 In the event a Party is unable to provide Emergency or Security Energy to the other when needed,\n\nbut there is energy available from a third-party Balancing Authority Area supplier, the Party will use\n\nreasonable efforts to transmit such energy to the other Party where feasible.\n\n**ARTICLE 4.0:** **RATES AND CHARGES**\n\n4.1 The charge for Emergency Energy delivered to the NBSO or to ISO-NE shall be as set forth in\n\nAttachment A, attached hereto.\n\n4.2 The charge for Security Energy delivered to ISO-NE shall be as set forth in Attachment B,\n\nattached hereto.\n\n**ARTICLE 5.0:** **MEASUREMENT OF ENERGY INTERCHANGED**\n\n5.1 All energy supplied at the Delivery Point shall be metered at the NBSO’s Keswick and Point\n\nLepreau Substations. The metered amounts shall be adjusted for actual losses to the Delivery Point.\n\n\n-----\n\nThis adjustment will be done to compensate for the difference in location between the Delivery Point and\n\nthe meters.\n\n5.2 Any properly designated representative of either of the Parties hereto shall have access, through\n\ncoordination with the meter owner, during normal business hours, to all of the billing meters for the\n\npurpose of reading the same. The accuracy of the meters shall be verified by proper tests periodically and\n\nat any other time upon reasonable notice given by either of the Parties to the other, and each of the Parties\n\nshall be entitled to have a representative present at such verification, subject to coordination with the\n\nmeter owner. In the event errors greater than +/-2% should be discovered, retroactive billing adjustments,\n\nif any, shall be determined by the Coordination Committee.\n\n**ARTICLE 6.0:** **BILLING AND PAYMENT**\n\n6.1 The procedure for rendering and payment of invoices for transactions pursuant to this Schedule\n\nshall be as set out hereunder unless otherwise agreed by the Coordination Committee.\n\n6.2 Promptly after the end of each calendar month, the Party delivering energy pursuant to this\n\nSchedule shall prepare or cause to be prepared and render an invoice to the other Party covering all\n\ntransactions conducted under the terms of this Schedule during such calendar month. All transactions will\n\nbe billed based on the schedule of energy agreed to by the Parties.\n\n6.3 All invoices rendered by a Party shall be payable by the other Party in currency of the USA by\n\nelectronic bank transfer, or in such other manner as is agreed to by the Coordination Committee, on the\n\nlater of (1) the twentieth day of each month or the first common banking day after the nineteenth day of\n\nthe month whichever is later (the “Due Date”).\n\n6.4 The currency exchange rate used to convert Canadian dollars, where required, to U.S. dollars in\n\npreparing the invoice will be that quoted by the Bank of Canada at noon on the last banking day of the\n\nmonth in which the Emergency or Security Energy being invoiced was delivered.\n\n6.5 If the rendering of an invoice is unavoidably delayed, a Party may issue an interim invoice based\n\non estimated charges. Each invoice shall be subject to adjustment for any errors in calculation, meter\n\nreadings, estimating or otherwise. Any such billing adjustments shall be made as promptly as practical,\n\nbut in no event later than six months after issuing the invoice.\n\n\n-----\n\n6.6 Any amount not paid by the Due Date shall be subject to interest, calculated from the due date of\n\nthe invoice to the date of payment, in accordance with the methodology specified for interest on refunds\n\nin the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s regulations at 18 C.F.R. § 35.19a (a) (2) (iii).\n\n6.7 If any invoice remains unpaid by a Party for thirty (30) days after the Due Date, the Party\n\nrendering the invoice may, in addition to all other remedies available to it, and after giving the other Party\n\nat least five days written notice of the its intention to do so, present the issue in question to that Party’s\n\nBoard of Directors. The Party’s Board of Directors shall contact the other Party’s Board of Directors or\n\nits designee to develop a solution to a billing Dispute pursuant to Article 17 of this Agreement. The\n\nBoards of Directors may also choose to submit the billing Dispute to a form of alternative dispute\n\nresolution to which the Boards of Directors may agree. Such action shall not be construed as a breach of\n\ncontract by the Party rendering the invoice and shall not relieve the other Party of its obligations to pay\n\nfor energy in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.\n\n6.8 The applicable provisions of this Schedule shall continue in effect after termination of this\n\nSchedule to the extent necessary to provide for final billing, billing adjustments, payments and disposition\n\nof any claims outstanding.\n\n6.9 Each Party warrants that it has, or will have, the agreements and procedures in place to ensure the\n\ncollection of payments from its participants for the delivery of Emergency or Security Energy to it from\n\nthe other Party.\n\n**ARTICLE 7.0:** **RECORDS**\n\n7.1 Each Party hereto shall keep or cause to be kept complete and accurate records and memoranda of\n\nits operations hereunder and shall maintain such data as may be necessary to determine with reasonable\n\naccuracy any item required hereunder. With respect to invoicing records, each Party shall maintain or\n\ncause to be maintained such records, memoranda and data for the current calendar year plus the previous\n\ncalendar year. The Coordination Committee shall have the right to examine all such records and\n\nmemoranda that are not confidential in so far as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of\n\nascertaining the reasonableness and accuracy of any statements of costs relating to transactions hereunder.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Attachment A**\n\n**To the Emergency and Security Energy Transactions Schedule**\n\n**Emergency Energy Pricing**\n\nIn accordance with the Emergency and Security Energy Transactions Schedule between the NBSO and\n\nISO-NE, the charge for Emergency Energy delivered to the Delivery Point by the NBSO or ISO-NE to\n\nthe other shall be as defined within this Attachment A.\n\n**A.1.** **Direct NBSO/ISO-NE Emergency Energy Transaction**\n\nThese are requests made by NBSO or ISO-NE to receive Emergency Energy in support of emergency\n\nreliability conditions presented by inadequate energy on its system that could not be supplied through the\n\nmarket.\n\nThe charge for Emergency Energy shall be calculated using the following two-part formula.

The Parties may jointly revise the\n\nlist by mutual written agreement. After the Parties mutually agree to changes, ISO-NE and NYISO shall\n\npost an updated list on their respective websites. The ISO-NE / NYISO List of Interconnection Facilities\n\nshall not be modified if either Party objects to a proposed change. The most current list developed by\n\nmutual agreement shall remain the official version of the list and neither Party shall knowingly post a list\n\nthat includes changes that are not the product of mutual agreement.\n\nThere are three (3) ISO-NE/NYISO Interconnections: the “NY/NE Northern AC Interconnection,” the\n\nNorthport-Norwalk Harbor Cable (“NNC Interconnection”), and the Cross Sound Cable (“CSC\n\nInterconnection”). For each Interconnection, NYISO and ISO-NE have identified respective associated\n\nInterties, Intertie metering points, and external nodes for scheduling and pricing purposes.\n\nFor Operational Control purposes, the point of demarcation for each of the Interconnections is the point at\n\nwhich the Interconnection (and its individual Interties) crosses the New England-New York State\n\nboundary, except as otherwise noted in the ISO-NE / NYISO List of Interconnection Facilities. The\n\nexternal nodes associated with each of the Interconnections are listed in Table 1 of Attachment A of\n\nSchedule C of this Agreement.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n**SCHEDULE B: Procedures For Development And Authorization**\n\n**Of Operating Instructions**\n\n**Overview**\n\nOperating Instructions (a) will be developed and recorded by the Parties, with assistance from the\n\nCoordination Committee, in accordance with this Schedule B, (b) will be contained in a document\n\nseparate from this Agreement, and (c) may be modified by the Parties, with assistance from the\n\nCoordination Committee, without amending this Agreement.\n\nThe Parties, with assistance from the Coordination Committee, shall jointly develop Operating\n\nInstructions and review them at least annually. The Parties, with assistance from the Coordination\n\nCommittee, shall submit draft material to one another for review and comment. The Parties, with\n\nassistance from the Coordination Committee, shall provide comment on the draft material promptly. The\n\nParties, with assistance from the Coordination Committee, shall promptly provide such information as\n\nmay reasonably be required in connection with establishing, or reviewing, the material. The Coordination\n\nCommittee shall be responsible for approving final versions of Operating Instructions.\n\nIn the event that any conflicts arise or are made apparent to a Party regarding any Operating Instructions,\n\nthey shall notify the other Party and engage the Coordination Committee, if necessary, to resolve such\n\nconflicts.\n\nThe Coordination Committee will periodically review applicable ISO-NE and NYISO individual\n\nprocedures and processes to determine any benefits of sharing these procedures and processes. These\n\nbenefits may be for the purpose of training or to satisfy Reliability Standards. The Coordination\n\nCommittee will determine how best to share these individual procedures and processes.\n\nA list of Operating Instructions and applicable ISO-NE and NYISO individual procedures will be\n\nmaintained by the Coordination Committee.\n\nOutlined below are the key principles and items of methodology to be observed while the Parties, with\n\nassistance from the Coordination Committee, are engaged in developing Operating Instructions, and\n\nissuing them to their respective operations staff.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n**Principles**\n\nGiven that the Parties’ respective operations staff benefit from following a single instruction for all\n\naspects of their execution of interconnected operations, it is an acceptable practice to combine this content\n\nto achieve the single Operating Instructions for use by a respective Party’s operations staff. The preferred\n\nmethodology when appropriate is to use the NPCC Criteria, Guides and Procedures for the coordination\n\nand operation of the interconnected Transmission Systems. When the NPCC documentation is\n\ninsufficient to accomplish this task separate instructions will be developed in accordance with this\n\nSchedule.\n\nEach Party shall coordinate the issuance internally of any Operating Instructions developed and agreed to\n\nby the Parties, with assistance from the Coordination Committee, to ensure that their respective\n\noperations staff has these Operating Instructions. In addition annual review of the Operating Instructions\n\nand the Parties’ internal procedures associated with the Operating Instructions shall be conducted by the\n\nParties, with assistance from the Coordination Committee, to ensure consistency.\n\nOperating Instructions, when approved by the Parties, shall be binding on the Parties insofar as they relate\n\nto the Interconnection Facilities until they expire, are changed, deleted, or superseded by authority of the\n\nParties, with assistance from the Coordination Committee.\n\n**Items of Methodology**\n\nBy mutual agreement of the Coordination Committee, one of the Parties shall be designated by the\n\nCoordination Committee to control the revision process of the Operating Instruction from the initial\n\ndrafting of material through to the conversion of the Operating Instruction into its final form.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n**SCHEDULE C: Emergency Energy Transactions Schedule**\n\nWHEREAS, ISO-NE, as the regional transmission organization for the New England Transmission\n\nSystem and the administrator of the New England markets, arranges for the sale and purchase of\n\nEmergency capacity and energy on behalf of Market Participants with neighboring Balancing Authority\n\nAreas, all in accordance with the ISO-NE Tariff, which includes the Open Access Transmission Tariff\n\nand ISO-NE market rules;\n\nWHEREAS, ISO-NE is responsible for, among other matters, procuring and acting as supplier of last\n\nresort of ancillary services (including arranging for the sale and purchase of Emergency capacity and\n\nenergy with neighboring Balancing Authority Areas), in accordance with the ISO-NE Tariff;\n\nWHEREAS, the NYISO, as the independent system operator of the New York Transmission System and\n\nthe administrator of the New York wholesale electricity markets, arranges for the sale and purchase of\n\nEmergency capacity and energy on behalf of Market Participants with neighboring Balancing Authority\n\nAreas, all in accordance with the NYISO Tariffs;\n\nWHEREAS, the NYISO is the administrator of the NYISO Tariffs and is responsible for, among other\n\nmatters, procuring and acting as supplier of last resort of ancillary services (including arranging for the\n\nsale and purchase of Emergency capacity and energy with neighboring Balancing Authority Areas), in\n\naccordance with the NYISO Tariffs;\n\nWHEREAS, either of the Parties may, from time to time, have insufficient Operating Reserve available\n\non the respective systems that they operate, or need to supplement available resources to cover sudden\n\nand unforeseen circumstances such as loss of equipment or forecast errors, and such conditions could\n\nresult in the need to arrange for the purchase of Emergency Energy for Reliability reasons;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants herein set forth, the\n\nParties mutually agree as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE I**\n\n1.0 **DELIVERY POINT**\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nThe Delivery Point for energy delivered pursuant to the terms of this Schedule shall be at one of three\n\npoints of Interconnection between the NYISO Balancing Authority Area and the ISO-NE Balancing\n\nAuthority Area, and at such other points of Interconnection as may be established. These three points of\n\nInterconnection are as follows: (1) the NY/NE Northern AC Interconnection[1]; (2) the NNC\n\nInterconnection; and (3) the Cross Sound Cable (CSC) Interconnection, which is a HVDC facility.\n\nUnless otherwise agreed by the Coordination Committee, the price for energy for an hour delivered\n\npursuant to this Schedule shall include all transmission costs of delivering such energy to the Delivery\n\nPoint in that hour, and the Party taking delivery of such energy for the hour shall be responsible for all\n\ntransmission costs beyond the Delivery Point for that hour.\n\n**ARTICLE II**\n\n**2.0** **CHARACTERISTICS OF EMERGENCY ENERGY**\n\n2.1 All Emergency Energy made available under this Schedule shall be three phase, 60 Hz alternating\n\ncurrent at operating voltages established at the Delivery Point in accordance with system requirements\n\nand appropriate to the Interconnection Facilities or other such characteristics as may be agreed upon by\n\nthe Parties.\n\n**ARTICLE III**\n\n**3.0** **NATURE OF SERVICE**\n\n3.1 ISO-NE and the NYISO shall, to the maximum extent each deems consistent with the safe and\n\nproper operation of its system, the furnishing of economical, dependable and satisfactory services by its\n\nparticipants, and the obligations of its participants to other parties, make available to the other Party when\n\na system Emergency exists on the other Party's system, Emergency Energy from its system's available\n\ngenerating capability in excess of the system’s load requirements (i.e., load requirements alone, not load\n\nplus reserve requirements) up to the transfer limits in use between the two Balancing Authority Areas.\n\nEmergency Energy is provided in cases of emergency outages of generating units, transmission lines or\n\nother equipment, or to meet other sudden and unforeseen circumstances such as forecast errors, or to\n\n1 The NY/NE Northern AC Interconnection, as defined in Schedule A – Interconnection Facilities (“Schedule A”) to\nthe Coordination Agreement between ISO-NE Inc. and the NYISO Inc.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nprovide sufficient Operating Reserve. Normally, a Party requests Emergency Energy from the other Party\n\nas a last resort, when market-based real-time energy transactions are not available, or not available in a\n\ntimely fashion in order to maintain its ten-minute reserve requirement. At the time the Emergency\n\nEnergy sale is being initiated, the Party delivering such Emergency Energy shall describe the Emergency\n\nEnergy transaction as being one of the following: (1) “delivered out of ten-minute reserve”; (2) “delivered\n\nout of thirty-minute reserve” where such a delivery could reasonably be expected to be recalled if the\n\nParty delivering the Emergency Energy needed the generation for a reserve pick-up or other Emergency;\n\nor (3) “delivered above and beyond ten-minute and thirty-minute reserves” where the Party delivering\n\nsuch Emergency Energy is normally expected to be able to continue delivering the energy following a\n\nreserve pick-up.\n\n3.2 The Parties are participants in the NPCC and are expected to comply with NPCC Criteria, Guides\n\nand Procedures. Such NPCC Criteria, Guides and Procedures include “Emergency Operation Criteria”\n\n(Document A-3), which describes the basic factors to be considered by a Balancing Authority Area in\n\nformulating plans and procedures to be followed in an Emergency. A principle of operation in this NPCC\n\nCriteria is that upon receiving a request for assistance to mitigate an Emergency, a Balancing Authority\n\nArea would provide “maximum reasonable assistance” to a neighboring Balancing Authority Area. Such\n\nreasonable assistance would not normally require the shedding of firm load.\n\n3.3 Normally, the Party experiencing or anticipating an Emergency would request Emergency Energy\n\nfrom the other Party in accordance with this Schedule and applicable NPCC Criteria, Guides and\n\nProcedures after all market-based real-time transactions have been scheduled, unless there is an\n\nimmediate need for such Emergency Energy in order to maintain system Reliability.\n\n3.4 In the event a Party is unable to provide Emergency Energy to the other when needed, but there is\n\nenergy available from a Third Party Balancing Authority Area supplier, the Party will use reasonable\n\nefforts to acquire and transmit such energy to the other Party where feasible.\n\n**ARTICLE IV**\n\n**4.0** **RATES AND CHARGES**\n\n4.1 The charge for Emergency Energy delivered to the NYISO or to ISO-NE shall be as set forth in\n\nAttachment A, attached hereto.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n4.2 Should activations of reserve sharing be required by either of the Parties, inadvertent interchanges\n\nwill intentionally be accumulated with each Balancing Authority Area providing assistance. In\n\naccordance with the NPCC “Procedures for Shared Activation of Ten Minute Reserve” (Document C-12),\n\nsuch inadvertent accumulations shall be treated as part of ordinary inadvertent energy.\n\n**ARTICLE V**\n\n**5.0** **MEASUREMENT OF ENERGY INTERCHANGED**\n\n5.1 All energy supplied at the Delivery Point shall be metered. The metered amounts shall be\n\nadjusted for actual losses to the Delivery Point on each of the Interconnection Facilities.  This adjustment\n\nwill be done to compensate for the difference in location between the Delivery Point and the meter.\n\n5.2 Any properly designated representative of either of the Parties hereto shall have access, through\n\ncoordination with the meter owner, during normal business hours, to all of the billing meters for the\n\npurpose of reading the same. The accuracy of the meters shall be verified by proper tests periodically and\n\nat any other time upon reasonable notice given by either of the Parties to the other, and each of the Parties\n\nshall be entitled to have a representative present at such verification, subject to coordination with the\n\nmeter owner. In the event errors greater than +/-2% should be discovered, retroactive billing adjustments,\n\nif any, shall be determined by the Coordination Committee.\n\n**ARTICLE VI**\n\n**6.0** **BILLING AND PAYMENT**\n\n6.1 The procedure for rendering and payment of invoices for transactions pursuant to this Schedule\n\nshall be as set out hereunder unless otherwise agreed by the Coordination Committee.\n\n6.2 The Party delivering energy pursuant to this Schedule shall promptly prepare, or cause to be\n\nprepared, and render an invoice to the other Party covering all transactions conducted under the terms of\n\nthis Schedule. All transactions will be billed based on the schedule of energy agreed to by the Parties.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n6.3 All invoices rendered by a Party shall be payable by the other Party in currency of the United\n\nStates of America by electronic bank transfer within five (5) business days after the issuance of an invoice\n\n(the “Due Date”).\n\n6.4 If the rendering of an invoice is unavoidably delayed, a Party may issue an interim invoice based\n\non estimated charges. Each invoice shall be subject to adjustment for any errors in calculation, meter\n\nreadings, estimating or otherwise. Any such billing adjustments shall be made as promptly as practical,\n\nbut in no event later than six months after issuing the invoice.\n\n6.5 Any amount not paid by the Due Date shall be subject to interest, calculated from the due date of\n\nthe invoice to the date of payment, in accordance with the methodology specified for interest on refunds\n\nin the FERC’s regulations at 18 C.F.R. § 35.19a (a) (2) (iii).\n\n6.6 If any invoice remains unpaid by a Party for thirty (30) days after the Due Date, the Party\n\nrendering the invoice may, in addition to all other remedies available to it, and after giving the other Party\n\nat least five days written notice of the its intention to do so, present the issue in question to that Party’s\n\nBoard of Directors. The Party’s Board of Directors shall contact the other Party’s Board of Directors or\n\nits designee to develop a solution to a billing Dispute pursuant to Article 17 of this Agreement. The\n\nBoards of Directors may also choose to submit the billing Dispute to a form of alternative Dispute\n\nresolution to which the Boards of Directors may agree.

The rules set forth in this Schedule D only apply at CTS Enabled Interfaces.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of this Schedule D and the Parties’ respective tariffs, CTS Interface Bids\n\nare ordinarily evaluated on a 15-minute basis utilizing forecasted real-time prices and forecasted system\n\ninformation from NYISO and forecasted real-time prices and forecasted system information from ISO\nNE. The evaluation will be performed by the NYISO’s Real-Time Commitment (RTC) optimization\n\nconsistent with the rules specified in the NYISO Services Tariff and this Schedule D.\n\nAs part of the iterative CTS process, NYISO will share forward looking RTC interchange schedules\n\nwith ISO-NE and these schedules will be used by ISO-NE as an input to develop a new set of forecasted\n\nprices and system information, which ISO-NE will then provide to NYISO for use in the next RTC\n\noptimization.\n\nIn accordance with Section 4 below, the RTC optimization will determine the External Interface\n\nCongestion component of the RTC LMP at a CTS Enabled Interface, which will subsequently be\n\nincorporated into the Parties’ real-time settlement LMPs.\n\nWheel-through transactions across a CTS Enabled Interface will be scheduled on an hourly basis.\n\nWheels through the NYCA will use decremental or sink price cap bids at CTS Enabled Interfaces.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nWheels through the NECA will use hourly CTS Interface Bids at CTS Enabled Interfaces for scheduling\n\nby the NYISO.\n\nThe Parties agree that CTS and its components will operate in accordance with this Schedule D and\n\nthe terms of the Parties’ respective tariffs.\n\n**ARTICLE II**\n\n**2.0** **SUBMITTAL OF CTS INTERFACE BIDS**\n\n2.1 CTS Interface Bid Submittal by New England Responsible Settlement Parties and their\n\nRepresentatives\n\nNYISO is hosting the platform used by both New York and New England Responsible Settlement\n\nParties to submit CTS Interface Bids. New York RSPs shall submit and confirm bids at CTS Enabled\n\nInterfaces in accordance with the NYISO Tariffs.\n\nAuthorized New England RSPs shall have access to the bidding platform for purposes of submitting\n\nbids at CTS Enabled Interfaces between the NECA and the NYCA. Such access will be provided under\n\nequivalent terms and conditions to New York RSPs.\n\nOn an hourly or more frequent basis ISO-NE shall provide NYISO with: (a) a list of all New England\n\nRSPs that are authorized to submit or confirm bids at CTS Enabled Interfaces and (b) identification\n\ninformation for each representative (i.e., an individual) that is authorized to submit or confirm bids at\n\nCTS Enabled Interfaces on behalf of a New England RSP. Only representatives designated by ISO-NE\n\nshall be permitted access to the platform that is used to submit bids at CTS Enabled Interfaces on behalf\n\nof a New England RSP. NYISO shall verify the authorization of a New England RSP and its\n\nrepresentative at the time a bid is submitted, confirmed, modified or deleted. If it has been more than two\n\nhours since the NYISO last received from ISO-NE an updated list of all authorized New England RSPs\n\nand identification information for each representative that is authorized to submit or confirm bids at CTS\n\nEnabled Interfaces on behalf of a New England RSP, then NYISO shall not allow any New England RSP\n\nto access the platform that is used to submit bids at CTS Enabled Interfaces until an updated list is\n\nreceived.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the event NYISO is not able to implement a new or changed status in a timely fashion, NYISO will\n\ninform ISO-NE of any delay it is aware of and the reason for the delay, and will implement the new or\n\nchanged status as soon as possible.\n\n2.2 Confirmation of New England Responsible Settlement Parties\n\nA representative submitting an initial or revised CTS Interface Bid, or a bid to schedule a wheel\n\nthrough the NYCA at a CTS Enabled External Proxy Bus must belong to an authorized RSP in either\n\nNYISO or ISO-NE. In that submittal, the representative must identify the participating RSP in the other\n\narea. The other participating RSP must confirm the submittal of the CTS Interface Bid or bid to wheel\n\nthrough the NYCA, in order for the bid to be valid. A CTS Interface Bid or a bid to wheel through the\n\nNYCA can be withdrawn by either participating RSP; no confirmation is required.\n\nAn RSP may establish a Confirmed Trust Relationship with another RSP such that the required\n\nconfirmation will be automatically granted for any submittal of a CTS Interface Bid or bid to wheel\n\nthrough the NYCA at a CTS Enabled External Proxy Bus that is submitted by the trusted RSP and\n\nincludes both RSPs as parties to the transaction. Upon representative action to submit, update or revoke a\n\nConfirmed Trust Relationship, NYISO shall verify that (i) the submittal identifies two authorized RSPs,\n\none in New York and one in New England and (ii) the representative belongs to the RSP that is granting\n\nthe Confirmed Trust Relationship to the other RSP.\n\nUpon representative action to submit or confirm an initial or revised CTS Interface Bid or bid to\n\nwheel through the NYCA, or to withdraw a CTS Interface Bid or bid to wheel through the NYCA at a\n\nCTS Enabled External Proxy Bus, the NYISO shall verify that (i) the submittal identifies two valid RSPs,\n\none in New York and one in New England, and (ii) the representative belongs to an RSP that is identified\n\non the submittal. If a Confirmed Trust Relationship exists between the two authorized RSPs and the\n\naction is taken by a representative that is associated with a trusted RSP to submit or confirm an initial or\n\nrevised CTS Interface Bid or bid to wheel through the NYCA, the bid shall be deemed submitted and\n\nconfirmed, or the revision confirmed.\n\nUpon receiving ISO-NE’s notice of suspension or termination of a New England RSP, which ISO-NE\n\nshall do consistent with its authority under the ISO-NE Tariff, NYISO will promptly:\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n1. cease honoring Confirmed Trust Relationships associated with the suspended or terminated New\n\nEngland RSP;\n\n2. within the real-time market day on which NYISO receives the instruction from ISO-NE, remove\n\nthe suspended or terminated New England RSP’s bids at CTS Enabled Interfaces that are offered\n\nin the NECA to NYCA direction;\n\n3. within the real-time market day on which NYISO receives the instruction from ISO-NE, remove\n\nbids at CTS Enabled Interfaces that are offered in the NECA to NYCA direction that include the\n\nNew England RSP as a trusted RSP;\n\n4. for all real-time market days subsequent to the real-time market day on which NYISO receives\n\nthe instruction from ISO-NE, remove all of the suspended or terminated New England RSP’s bids\n\nat CTS Enabled Interfaces; and\n\n5. for all real-time market days subsequent to the real-time market day on which NYISO receives\n\nthe instruction from ISO-NE, remove all bids at CTS Enabled Interfaces that include the\n\nsuspended or terminated New England RSP as a trusted RSP.\n\nThe five changes enumerated above will be effectuated prospectively. The Parties will not effectuate\n\nchanges one through three for a real-time market hour in which RSPs are no longer able to submit or\n\nmodify bids.\n\nISO-NE will curtail the e-tags for the transactions associated with the bids NYISO is required to\n\nremove under the rules set forth above.\n\nIn the event NYISO is not able to implement a new or changed status that is addressed in this Section\n\n2.2 in a timely fashion, NYISO will inform ISO-NE of any delay it is aware of and the reasons for the\n\ndelay, and will implement the new or changed status as soon as possible.\n\nIf the NYISO is unable to verify that the required confirmations have been received, then the CTS\n\nInterface Bid or bid to wheel through the NYCA shall not be considered in the RTC optimization.\n\nIf the NYISO is not able to validate an RSP or a representative, then that entity or person will not be\n\nable to submit, modify, confirm or delete a CTS Interface Bid or a bid to wheel through the NYCA.\n\n**ARTICLE III**\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n**3.0** **CALCULATION OF ISO-NE SUPPLY PRICE POINTS**\n\nEach quarter-hour, ISO-NE shall calculate a set of forecast energy prices at its External Proxy Buses\n\nfor each CTS Enabled Interface corresponding to varying interchange levels on that interface. The results\n\nwill be provided to NYISO as increasing MW-price pairs, where the MW value represents a net\n\ninterchange level on the CTS Enabled Interface and the price value represents ISO-NE’s forecast of its\n\nreal-time LMP for its External Proxy Bus at that net interchange MW level. ISO-NE will provide no\n\nfewer than one and no more than 11 MW-price pairs for each of ten consecutive quarter-hour intervals,\n\nwhich are referred to as the “ISO-NE Supply Price Points.”\n\nThe ISO-NE Supply Price Points are created with a forward-looking, security-constrained economic\n\ndispatch system that co-optimizes energy and reserve requirements. This forward-looking co\noptimization will assume the same units are committed as are previously committed, or scheduled to be\n\ncommitted, in ISO-NE’s real-time production system. The energy from currently uncommitted fast-start\n\ngeneration will also be considered for dispatch in the forward-looking co-optimization. ISO-NE Supply\n\nPrice Points shall be calculated using the current production data for load forecasts, active transmission\n\nconstraints, state estimator data, Market Participant energy re-offers, wind forecasts, forecasted net\n\ninterchange on all Interconnections (including forward looking RTC interchange schedules provided by\n\nNYISO), and operator updates to resource limits.\n\n**ARTICLE IV**\n\n**4.0** **SCHEDULING EXTERNAL TRANSACTIONS AT CTS ENABLED INTERFACES**\n\n4.1 Evaluation of CTS Interface Bids\n\nThe RTC will use the CTS Interface Bids and the ISO-NE Supply Price Points to economically\n\nschedule the CTS Interface Bids and determine the net interchange schedules. The economic scheduling\n\nof the CTS Interface Bids will be performed simultaneously with the scheduling of internal NYCA\n\nresources and external transactions at other NYCA Interconnections.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nFor an RTC optimization that schedules hourly CTS Interface Bids, the RTC will use the ISO-NE\n\nSupply Price Points for each 15-minute interval of the hour. An hourly CTS Interface Bid will be\n\nscheduled if it is economic for the hour.\n\nFor an RTC optimization that schedules CTS Interface Bids at 15-minute intervals, the RTC\n\noptimization will use ISO-NE Supply Price Points that have been adjusted to account for the hourly RTC\n\nexternal transaction schedules established at CTS Enabled Interfaces, including any scheduled Emergency\n\nEnergy.\n\nWhen there are multiple CTS Interface Bids at the same bid price but not all of them can be\n\neconomically cleared, the CTS Interface Bids with the same price will be scheduled pro-rata.\n\nThe RTC optimization incorporates Ramp Limits and Transfer Limits in the manner described in\n\nSection 5 of this Schedule D to economically schedule CTS Interface Bids and shall determine: (1) the net\n\ninterchange schedule for each CTS Enabled Interface, (2) the RTC LMP for each CTS Enabled External\n\nProxy Bus, and (3) the External Interface Congestion at each CTS Enabled Interface.\n\n4.2 External Interface Congestion Price Assignment\n\nThe RTC optimization will determine the External Interface Congestion at an External Proxy Bus for\n\na CTS Enabled Interface if the net interchange schedule is limited in the RTC solution due to one or more\n\nof the following four reasons: (i) there are more economic transactions offered in a common direction\n\n(import or export) than the Transfer Limit of the External Proxy Bus can accommodate, or (ii) there are\n\nfewer economic transactions offered in a common direction (import or export) than the Transfer Limit\n\nrequires, or (iii) the NYCA (system-wide) Ramp Limit prevents the RTC from scheduling one or more\n\nexternal transactions at the External Proxy Bus consistent with the economics of the underlying bids, or\n\n(iv) a Ramp Limit prevents the RTC from scheduling one or more external transactions consistent with\n\nthe economics of the underlying bids (collectively, the “External Proxy Bus Constraints”).\n\nWhenever an External Proxy Bus Constraint at a CTS Enabled Interface is limiting in the RTC\n\noptimization, the External Interface Congestion at the External Proxy Bus will be assigned, in whole or in\n\npart, as set forth below.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n**ISO-NE Limiting: If the RTC optimization is limited by a Transfer Limit determined by an**\n\nISO-NE Operating Reserve limitation, an ISO-NE minimum generation limitation, or an ISO-NE\n\ncapacity deliverability limit, including when the Transfer Limit is adjusted in accordance with\n\nSection 5.4 of this Schedule D to accommodate the Ramp Limit while implementing one of these\n\nlimitations, then the portion of the External Interface Congestion associated with the External\n\nProxy Bus Constraint shall be assigned to ISO-NE.\n\n**NYISO Limiting: If the RTC optimization is limited by NYCA-wide Ramp Limits, then the**\n\nportion of the External Interface Congestion associated with the External Proxy Bus Constraint\n\nshall be assigned to NYISO.\n\n**NYISO and ISO-NE Limiting: If the RTC optimization is limited by any Ramp Limit or**\n\nTransfer Limit that is not specifically addressed in the “ISO-NE Limiting” or “NYISO Limiting”\n\nparagraphs above, or by any Transfer Limit or Ramp Limit that results from an operator override,\n\nas described in Section 5.2.5 of this Schedule D, the portion of the External Interface Congestion\n\nfor a CTS Enabled Interface that is associated with an External Proxy Bus Constraint shall be\n\nassigned to both Parties equally.\n\nThe RTC solution may be limited by multiple External Proxy Bus Constraints simultaneously. If this\n\noccurs, the foregoing rules will apply to each External Proxy Bus Constraint.\n\nIf there are not sufficient CTS Interface Bid MWs offered to achieve a Transfer Limit, RTC will\n\nschedule the available MWs. In these circumstances, RTC will determine the External Interface\n\nCongestion at the External Proxy Bus based on the NYISO’s Transmission Shortage Costs as defined in\n\nthe NYISO Tariff.\n\nIn order to provide consistent price signals between their respective real-time energy markets, the\n\nParties shall each incorporate the foregoing process into the real-time settlement LMP at their External\n\nProxy Bus for each CTS Enabled Interface.\n\n**ARTICLE V**\n\n**5.0** **CTS ENABLED INTERFACE OPERATING RULES**\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n5.1 CTS Enabled Interface Ramp Limits\n\nThe default quarter-hour Ramp Limit for the NY/NE Northern AC Interconnection will be mutually\n\nagreed to by the Parties and posted on the NYISO’s OASIS.\n\nThe default top-of-the-hour Ramp Limit for the NY/NE Northern AC Interconnection (for use when\n\nquarter-hour scheduling is unavailable) will be mutually agreed to by the Parties and posted on the\n\nNYISO’s OASIS.\n\nIn real-time operations, when necessary to protect reliability, the Parties may mutually agree to\n\ntemporarily change the Ramp Limit(s) at any CTS Enabled Interface. The Parties shall restore the\n\nmodified Ramp Limit to the posted default Ramp Limit as soon as reliable system operations permit and\n\nit is practicable to do so.\n\n5.2 Transfer Limits Reflecting Reliability Conditions\n\nA Transfer Limit sets the minimum or maximum net interchange that can be scheduled on a CTS\n\nEnabled Interface in the RTC solution. Factors that can set the Transfer Limits include the following:\n\n1. normal scheduling limits;\n\n2. Operating Reserve limitations;\n\n3. minimum generation limitations;\n\n4. capacity requests;\n\n5. operator overrides.\n\n_5.2.1 Normal Scheduling Limits_\n\nThe normal scheduling limit for a CTS Enabled Interface is the amount of electric power that can\n\nnormally be transferred over a CTS Enabled Interface. The Parties may mutually agree to change the\n\nnormal scheduling limits that are used at CTS Enabled Interfaces due to transmission outages, generation\n\noutages or other changes in system conditions. In the event the change to a normal scheduling limit is\n\nplanned in advance, the Parties will make reasonable efforts to change the values in time to be included in\n\nthe clearing of their respective day-ahead energy markets and be publicly posted prior to implementation.\n\nFor the real-time operating day, ISO-NE will send its normal scheduling limits at each CTS Enabled\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nInterface to the NYISO via the electronic data exchange to cover the same ten consecutive quarter-hour\n\nintervals as ISO-NE’s Supply Price Points.\n\n_5.2.2 Operating Reserve Limitations_\n\nIf one Control Area experiences an Operating Reserve deficiency, the other Control Area is not\n\nobligated to go deficient in its reserves of the same or a higher quality product, but may go deficient in a\n\nlower-quality reserve product in order to prevent an Operating Reserve deficiency of a higher quality\n\nreserve product in the other Control Area. To ensure these mutual reliability objectives can be satisfied,\n\nthe Parties may modify the Transfer Limits in certain conditions as described below.\n\nThe RTC optimization procures reserves to meet the NYISO’s reserve requirements and prices\n\nshortages of reserves using the NYISO’s Operating Reserve demand curves. The RTC does not have\n\ninformation on the amount of Operating Reserve in the NECA. Therefore, at CTS Enabled Interfaces,\n\nISO-NE will use the electronic data exchange to provide to NYISO both the ISO-NE Supply Price Points\n\nand Transfer Limit values that reflect the net interchange required to meet ISO-NE’s 10-minute and 30\nminute reserve requirements. When calculated, these values will reflect the net interchange required to\n\nmeet ISO-NE’s 10-minute and 30-minute reserve requirements for the same ten consecutive quarter-hour\n\nintervals for which ISO-NE’s Supply Price Points are provided. ISO-NE will calculate these Transfer\n\nLimit values for each interval based on the Operating Reserve surplus in the NECA when applying the\n\nforecasted RTC net interchange on the CTS Enabled Interface. For the purposes of Schedule D, the ISO\nNE Transfer Limit associated with the 10-minute reserve requirement will always be less restrictive than\n\nthe Transfer Limit associated with the ISO-NE 30-minute reserve requirement. When ISO-NE sends\n\nTransfer Limits that are associated with Operating Reserve requirements, the ISO-NE Supply Price Points\n\nmust also reflect those expected reserve shortage prices. RTC will evaluate whether the ISO-NE Transfer\n\nLimit would preclude NYISO from meeting its reserve requirements for an equal or higher quality reserve\n\nproduct. If so, RTC may adjust the Transfer Limit in accordance with Section 5.3 of this Schedule D,\n\nbased on the principles set forth in the preceding paragraph.\n\n_5.2.3 Minimum Generation Limitations_\n\nThe RTC optimization dispatches the NYISO system’s internal generation as needed when the NYCA\n\napproaches minimum generation conditions. The RTC does not have information to assess minimum\n\ngeneration conditions within the NECA. Therefore, at CTS Enabled Interfaces, ISO-NE will use the\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nelectronic data exchange to provide to NYISO Transfer Limit values that reflect the net interchange level\n\nbeyond which ISO-NE cannot further dispatch down internal generation while maintaining reliable\n\noperations. When ISO-NE sends Transfer Limits for this purpose, the ISO-NE Supply Price Points must\n\nalso reflect these requirements.\n\nISO-NE shall not send, and NYISO is not required to enforce, a minimum generation Transfer Limit\n\nthat would require the NYCA to accept energy from the NECA.\n\nISO-NE shall not send both a minimum generation Transfer Limit and Operating Reserve Transfer\n\nLimits at the same time.\n\n_5.2.4 Capacity Transfer Limits_\n\nDay-Ahead Coordination\n\nNYISO will provide its day-ahead operating plan to ISO-NE. Once ISO-NE determines that it\n\nexpects to count on capacity resources located in New York to meet its reserve requirements, ISO-NE\n\nshall inform NYISO of the expected capacity call.\n\nReal-Time Coordination\n\nISO-NE Capacity Requests at CTS Enabled Interfaces:\n\nISO-NE may request delivery of energy from capacity resources located in the NYCA that have\n\nobligations in the ISO-NE capacity market over a CTS Enabled Interface. The ISO-NE operator\n\nwill call the NYISO operator to initiate the capacity request. Upon receiving the request, the\n\nNYISO operator will confirm what amount of the capacity request is deliverable based on\n\nprojected transmission constraints (“Capacity Deliverable to ISO-NE”). If the Capacity\n\nDeliverable to ISO-NE is non-zero, RTC will determine the ISO-NE capacity that is available\n\nbased on offers submitted by NYCA generators that have sold their capacity to ISO-NE and are\n\nprojected to be available in real-time, subject to any real-time derates (“Capacity Available to\n\nISO-NE”).\n\nTransactions to wheel capacity through the NYCA will be excluded from the ISO-NE/NYISO\n\ncapacity request process.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nNYISO Capacity Requests at CTS Enabled Interfaces:\n\nIf the NYISO projects the ISO-NE real-time capacity request could cause the NYISO to become\n\ncapacity deficient, the NYISO may request delivery of energy associated with capacity resources\n\nlocated in ISO-NE that have an obligation in the NYISO capacity market over a CTS Enabled\n\nInterface. The NYISO operator will call the ISO-NE operator to initiate the capacity request.\n\nThe NYISO will require that its eligible New England-based capacity submit CTS Interface Bids\n\nto be evaluated by RTC. It will be up to the supplier of New England-based capacity to ensure\n\nthat the resource(s) backing capacity transactions are available to deliver their capacity to New\n\nYork when they are called on to do so. At the time of the request, the ISO-NE operator will\n\ndetermine whether all or any part of the generation supporting the capacity is available and\n\ndeliverable (“Capacity Available to NYISO”).\n\nSection 5.3 of this Schedule D sets forth how capacity data and Operating Reserve limitations are\n\nused to establish a Transfer Limit.\n\n_5.2.5 Operator Override Transfer Limits_\n\nReal-time system conditions may require that a NYISO or ISO-NE operator override the Transfer\n\nLimit to establish the flow that can be transferred over a CTS Enabled Interface in a reliable manner.\n\nExcept when necessary to protect reliability, an operator override shall not be used to submit limits that\n\ncan be submitted via the electronic data exchange.\n\n5.3 Establishing Transfer Limits for RTC\n\nRTC determines a net interchange for each interval that must be a value between an upper bound and\n\nlower bound. In this section, the high Transfer Limit is the upper bound on that range and the low\n\nTransfer Limit is the lower bound on that range. The rules in this Section 5.3 detail how the inputs from\n\nSection 5.2, which are first tested against the criteria set forth in Section 7.2, are used to determine the\n\nhigh and low Transfer Limits in RTC for each quarter-hour interval. For purposes of this Section 5.3, a\n\npositive value represents flow from New England to New York, and a negative value represents flow\n\nfrom New York to New England. The values associated with an ISO-NE capacity request, Capacity\n\nDeliverable to ISO-NE and Capacity Available to ISO-NE are all negative.\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n1. When a Minimum Generation Transfer Limit is provided by ISO-NE in accordance with Section\n\n5.2.3, that value is the low Transfer Limit at a CTS Enabled Interface.\n\n2. When ISO-NE provides Operating Reserve Transfer Limits but has not requested capacity from\n\nNYISO, the following rules are applied to determine the high Transfer Limit at a CTS Enabled\n\nInterface:\n\na) If the ISO-NE 30-minute Operating Reserve Transfer Limit is greater than or equal to zero, then:\n\ni. If enforcing the ISO-NE 30-minute Operating Reserve Transfer Limit is projected to cause\n\nthe NYISO to have a deficiency of 10-minute Operating Reserve, the high Transfer Limit is\n\nthe minimum value that is not projected to result in a NYISO 10 minute Operating Reserve\n\ndeficiency;\n\nii. Otherwise the high Transfer Limit is the ISO-NE 30-minute Operating Reserve Transfer\n\nLimit.\n\nb) If the ISO-NE 30-minute Operating Reserve Transfer Limit is less than zero, then:\n\ni. If enforcing the ISO-NE 30-minute Operating Reserve Transfer Limit is projected to cause\n\nthe NYISO to have a deficiency of 30-minute Operating Reserve but is not projected to cause\n\nthe NYISO to have a deficiency of 10-minute Operating Reserve, then the high Transfer\n\nLimit is the lesser of (a) the minimum value that is not projected to result in a NYISO 30\nminute Operating Reserve deficiency, or (b) zero;\n\nii. If enforcing the ISO-NE 30-minute Operating Reserve Transfer Limit is projected to cause\n\nthe NYISO to have a deficiency of 10-minute Operating Reserve, then the high Transfer\n\nLimit is the minimum value that is not projected to result in a NYISO 10-minute Operating\n\nReserve deficiency;\n\niii. Otherwise the high Transfer Limit is the ISO-NE 30-minute Operating Reserve Transfer\n\nLimit.\n\n3. When ISO-NE has requested capacity from NYISO, the high Transfer Limit at a CTS Enabled\n\nInterface shall be the greater of:\n\na) the ISO-NE 30-minute Operating Reserve Transfer Limit, or\n\nb) [the minimum of (i) the total quantity of CTS Interface Bids backing Capacity Available to\n\nNYISO or (ii) the Capacity Available to NYISO] plus [the maximum of (iii) the ISO-NE capacity\n\nrequest, (iv) the Capacity Deliverable to ISO-NE or (v) the Capacity Available to ISO-NE].\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\n4. When system conditions require that either a low or high Transfer Limit be overridden by the NYISO\n\nor ISO-NE operator to establish the flow that can be transferred over a CTS Enabled Interface in a\n\nreliable manner, the override shall establish the low or high Transfer Limit.\n\n5. Otherwise, the NYISO shall use the normal scheduling Transfer Limit at a CTS Enabled Interface, as\n\ndescribed in Section 5.2.1.\n\n5.4. Interaction Between Transfer Limits and Ramp Limits\n\na) Except as provided in 5.4(b), when the NYISO’s RTC is provided Transfer Limits that would\n\ncause it to develop net interchange schedules at a CTS Enabled Interface with ISO-NE that\n\nexceed the Ramp Limits, RTC will reset the provided Transfer Limits to ensure the agreed Ramp\n\nLimits are not exceeded.\n\nb) If any Transfer Limit, other than a normal scheduling limit, is implemented via an operator\n\noverride, then RTC shall permit the agreed Ramp Limits to be exceeded in order to enforce the\n\nTransfer Limit.\n\n**ARTICLE VI**\n\n**6.0** **SETTLEMENT PROVISIONS**\n\nISO-NE shall settle CTS Interface Bids and other bids and offers scheduled at CTS Enabled\n\nInterfaces with its Market Participants in accordance with the rules set forth in the ISO-NE Tariff.\n\nThe NYISO shall settle CTS Interface Bids and other bids scheduled at CTS Enabled Interfaces, with\n\nits Market Participants in accordance with the rules set forth in the NYISO Tariffs.\n\nEach Party shall address settlement-related corrections and disputes regarding that Party’s settlement\n\nof CTS transactions in accordance with the settlement correction and dispute resolution provisions set\n\nforth in that Party’s tariff(s).\n\nEach Party agrees to provide support, including information and data that isn’t otherwise available to\n\nthe other Party, when the requested information is necessary to assist the requesting Party in addressing a\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nsettlement (but not price) correction or a settlement-related dispute between the requesting Party and one\n\nor more of its Market Participants regarding the settlement of CTS transactions.\n\nIf an erroneous price is determined at a CTS Enabled External Proxy Bus, independent of any price\n\ncorrection process ISO-NE may utilize, the NYISO shall follow the price correction process set forth in\n\nAttachment E to its Market Administration and Control Area Services Tariff.\n\nIf an erroneous price is determined at a CTS Enabled External Proxy Bus, independent of any price\n\ncorrection process NYISO may utilize, ISO-NE shall follow the price correction process set forth in the\n\nISO-NE Tariff.\n\n**ARTICLE VII**\n\n**7.0** **NON-STANDARD CTS OPERATION**\n\n7.1 Permitted Modifications to ISO-NE Supply Price Points\n\nIn the event NYISO does not receive the ISO-NE Supply Price Points before it commences the RTC\n\noptimization, then the last set of ISO-NE Supply Price Points used to perform an RTC optimization will\n\nbe used in the RTC optimization to determine the net interchange schedule until the NYISO receives and\n\nsuccessfully validates a new set of ISO-NE Supply Price Points.\n\nIf one or more quarter-hour intervals within the ISO-NE Supply Price Points fail the NYISO’s input\n\nchecks, the last set of ISO-NE Supply Price Points used to perform an RTC optimization will be used in\n\nthe RTC optimization.\n\nWhen ISO-NE Supply Price Points do not cover the full quantity (in MWs) of bids that are evaluated\n\nby RTC, then the last pricing point on either end of the ISO-NE Supply Price Points will be extended by\n\nNYISO to cover all the bids and offers that are evaluated by RTC.\n\n7.2 Permitted Modifications to ISO-NE Transfer Limits\n\nEffective Date: 5/4/2021 - Docket #: ER21-1278-000\n\n\n-----\n\nIn the event NYISO does not receive ISO-NE Transfer Limits or operator override values have not\n\nbeen entered before an RTC optimization commences, then the last set of ISO-NE Transfer Limits used to\n\nperform an RTC optimization will be used in the current RTC optimization.\n\nIf one or more quarter-hour intervals within the ISO-NE Transfer Limits fail any of the NYISO’s\n\ninput checks, including the input checks listed below, the last set of ISO-NE Transfer Limits used to\n\nperform an RTC optimization will be used in the RTC optimization.\n\n  - A Minimum Generation Transfer Limit and Operating Reserve Transfer Limits will not be sent at\n\nthe same time.\n\n  - The Minimum Generation Transfer Limit will be less than or equal to zero.\n\n  - If an ISO-NE 10-minute Operating Reserve Transfer Limit is provided, an ISO-NE 30-minute\n\nOperating Reserve Transfer Limit will also be provided.\n\n  - The ISO-NE 30-minute Operating Reserve Transfer Limit will be less than the ISO-NE 10\nminute Operating Reserve Transfer Limit.\n\n7.3 Hourly Scheduling Under CTS\n\nThe Parties may agree to temporarily employ hourly scheduling in RTC on a CTS Enabled Interface\n\nwhen necessary to ensure or preserve system reliability or when not able to implement schedules as\n\nexpected due to software or communication issues.\n\n**ARTICLE VIII**\n\n**8.0** **JOINT ENERGY SCHEDULING SYSTEM CUSTOMER SERVICE;
