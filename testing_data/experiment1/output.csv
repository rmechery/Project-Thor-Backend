1. **Capability Assessment**: Each Market Participant (MP) or Transmission Owner (TO) must have the capability to reduce system load demand by at least 1.5% when a voltage reduction is initiated.

2. **Testing Conditions**: The voltage reduction is tested at various plant output levels (from 0% to 100% in 10% intervals) to ensure that the system can maintain a preferred terminal voltage range for generating facilities.

3. **Implementation**: The actual reduction in voltage is implemented through control strategies that have been pre-established, ensuring that the voltage reduction is effective and within the operational limits of the system.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: During the test, the voltage profile is monitored, and the minimum and maximum voltages are recorded to assess the impact of the reduction.

1. **Good-Faith Negotiations**: Initially, any dispute must be subject to good-faith negotiations among the ISO, affected Transmission Owners (ITCs), and market participants. Each party must designate representatives with the authority to negotiate.

2. **Negotiation Period**: The parties are required to engage in negotiations for a minimum of 60 calendar days. However, if there are exigent circumstances, expedited resolution may be sought through the Commission or a relevant court or agency.

3. **Further Resolution Options**: If the dispute is not resolved through negotiations, it may be submitted to the Commission for resolution. Parties can also agree to alternative dispute resolution methods, such as arbitration, if all affected parties consent.

This process ensures that disputes are handled systematically and allows for various avenues of resolution depending on the circumstances.
