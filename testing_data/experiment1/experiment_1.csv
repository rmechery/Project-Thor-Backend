Key points include:
- Identification of the cause of frequency decline.
- Communication with interconnected Reliability Coordinators and Balancing Authorities.
- Actions to maintain frequency and manage interchange schedules.

1. **Identification of the Deficient RCA/BAA**: It is crucial to identify the RCA or Balancing Authority Area (BAA) that is causing the frequency decline to expedite corrective actions.

2. **Communication with Interconnected RCAs/BAAs**: ISO System Operators will establish communication with other interconnected RCAs/BAAs to determine the cause of the frequency decline and the necessary actions to restore frequency to 60.00 Hz.

3. **Actions if the Cause is Outside New England RCA/BAA**:
   - Confirm existing interchange schedules with adjacent NPCC BAAs.
   - Regulate the New England RCA/BAA ties to maintain Frequency Biased Interchange Schedules.
   - Increase the amount of Synchronized Reserve to adjust the Interchange Schedule further if needed.

4. **Manual Load Shedding**: If a sub-area of the New England RCA/BAA is experiencing abnormal voltage or reactive conditions, manual load shedding may be implemented as per ISO New England Operating Procedure No. 7 (OP-7) if necessary.

5. **Assistance Requests**: If another NPCC RCA/BAA is experiencing a capacity deficiency and requests assistance, ISO may provide help, which could reduce the New England RCA/BAA's operating reserve below required levels.

6. **Mitigation of Serious Threats**: The procedure may also be implemented for any serious threat to the integrity of the Bulk Electric System (BES) as determined by ISO.

These steps are part of a broader set of procedures aimed at maintaining system reliability during low frequency conditions.
