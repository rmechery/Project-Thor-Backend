Here\u2019s an overview of the procedure background:\n\n### Key Components of the Procedure\n\n1. **Eligibility Requirements**:\n   - Each Designated Blackstart Resource (DBR) must complete a successful test and meet specific testing and reporting requirements within the past 12 months.\n\n2. **Coordination with Transmission Owners**:\n   - Blackstart Owners must coordinate with the applicable Transmission Owner (TO) to submit any necessary transmission outage requests. This is essential for isolating the DBR or energizing equipment during testing.\n\n3. **Outage Application Submission**:\n   - An outage application must be submitted through the ISO\u2019s outage scheduling software. This includes requests for generator outages.\n\n4. **Testing Requirements**:\n   - The test must demonstrate the resource's ability to control frequency and voltage, manage interconnection voltage, and consider geographic location and proximity to critical infrastructure (e.g., nuclear plants).\n\n5. **Documentation and Compliance**:\n   - Blackstart Owners must provide documented evidence of their blackstart performance, complying with audit testing and documentation requirements.\n\n6. **ISO Oversight**:\n   - ISO or the System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) has the right to be present during the test and inspect relevant procedures and records.\n\n### Performance Evaluation Criteria\n\nThe evaluation for a successful test includes:\n- Frequency control capability\n- Voltage control capability\n- Time between system shutdown and resource availability for electrical loading\n- Geographic location considerations\n\n### Additional Information\n\n- Blackstart Owners can obtain data regarding their DBR's test history from the ISO Market Information System (MIS).\n- The procedure is governed by the requirements outlined in Schedule 16 of the ISO New England Open Access Transmission Tariff.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation from ISO New England.\n\n### Sources\n- [ISO New England](https:\/\/www.iso-ne.com)","reference":"Blackstart capability tests are submitted and scheduled using the process defined in SOP-RTMKTS.0180.0080 Process Designated Blackstart Resource Testing.
