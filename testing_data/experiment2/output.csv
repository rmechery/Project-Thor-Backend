3. **Review Requirements**: Check the specific requirements and conditions that may have led to the denial. This may include compliance with testing and reporting requirements.

4. **Submit an Informational Application**: If the denial does not impact generator startup or notification times, an informational application should still be submitted through the ISO’s outage scheduling software.

5. **Consider Alternative Actions**: Depending on the feedback received, the Generator Operator may need to adjust their approach or resubmit the request after addressing any concerns.

6. **Follow Up**: Maintain communication with the TO or ISO to ensure that any issues are resolved and to facilitate future testing opportunities.

The Blackstart Capability Test is a critical procedure for ensuring that designated resources can effectively restore power to the grid after a blackout. Here’s an overview of the procedure background:

### Key Components of the Procedure

1. **Eligibility Requirements**:
   - Each Designated Blackstart Resource (DBR) must complete a successful test and meet specific testing and reporting requirements within the past 12 months.

2. **Coordination with Transmission Owners**:
   - Blackstart Owners must coordinate with the applicable Transmission Owner (TO) to submit any necessary transmission outage requests. This is essential for isolating the DBR or energizing equipment during testing.

3. **Outage Application Submission**:
   - An outage application must be submitted through the ISO’s outage scheduling software. This includes requests for generator outages.

4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - The test must demonstrate the resource's ability to control frequency and voltage, manage interconnection voltage, and consider geographic location and proximity to critical infrastructure (e.g., nuclear plants).

5. **Documentation and Compliance**:
   - Blackstart Owners must provide documented evidence of their blackstart performance, complying with audit testing and documentation requirements.

6. **ISO Oversight**:
   - ISO or the System Restoration Working Group (SRWG) has the right to be present during the test and inspect relevant procedures and records.

### Performance Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation for a successful test includes:
- Frequency control capability
- Voltage control capability
- Time between system shutdown and resource availability for electrical loading
- Geographic location considerations

### Additional Information

- Blackstart Owners can obtain data regarding their DBR's test history from the ISO Market Information System (MIS).
- The procedure is governed by the requirements outlined in Schedule 16 of the ISO New England Open Access Transmission Tariff.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation from ISO New England.

### First Step
The first step in the procedure to perform a blackstart capability test is to **coordinate with the applicable Transmission Owner (TO)**. This coordination ensures that any required transmission outage requests for equipment necessary to isolate the Designated Blackstart Resource (DBR) or equipment that needs to be energized during the testing are submitted through the transmission outage coordination process.

### Primary Responsibility
The primary responsibility for performing the blackstart capability test lies with the **Blackstart Owner**. They are required to ensure compliance with the testing and reporting requirements, including submitting the necessary outage applications.

### Summary of Responsibilities
- **Blackstart Owner**: 
  - Coordinate with the TO.
  - Submit outage applications.
  - Ensure compliance with testing requirements.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the ISO New England documentation on blackstart resources and testing procedures.
